      <description>As part of a new homeserver build I plan to finish this year, I wanted to look into where the ecosystem is regarding LUKS volumes unlocked by TPM. This was sparked from how seamless it was when I set up my framework last year.
I gave my self a few conditions for this setup I would like to meet. The first one is Secure boot, it&amp;rsquo;s 2025, I should be able to do this by now, I also became aware of tooling that makes this easier.</description>
