      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of a new homeserver build I plan to finish this year, I wanted to look into where the ecosystem is regarding LUKS volumes unlocked by TPM. This was sparked from how seamless it was when I set up my framework last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave my self a few conditions for this setup I would like to meet.
The first one is Secure boot, it&amp;rsquo;s 2025, I should be able to do this by now, I also became aware of tooling that makes this easier.
I would like this setup to use sdboot, for really no particular reason than to try something else than grub. If I could fulfill this, UKI could also be a additional implementation detail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
